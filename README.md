# odin-sign-up-form
The Odin Project | Sign Up Form
<h3>What did I learn in this project?</h3>
- Form validation using HTML and some CSS, no JavaScript yet<br>
- Slightly learned some RegEx to properly make the form validation<br>
- Learned how to use the :invalid and :focus tags<br>
- Learned how to use ::before and ::after<br>
- Some more flexbox knowledge (always helps)<br>
- Knowing that I'm getting more comfortable being able to reproduce certain webpage designs from scratch if necessary<br>
